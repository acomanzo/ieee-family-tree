# ieee-family-tree
The purpose of this app is to let users document their family trees. I made this app as a personal project and as a workshop material for the
UAlbany IEEE Student Chapter. I presented Part 1 on Thursday October 22nd 2020 and plan on hosting more workshops so that members can learn 
how to build the entire app. The materials associated with Part 1 can be found here: 
[Part 1](https://github.com/UAlbany-IEEE-Student-Branch/Workshops-Fall-2020/tree/master/Workshop%207%20-%20Android%20Family%20Tree%20Part%201 "Explore the rest of our hard work, too!")

The intial commit reflects the progress I made in the first six days of development. So far, it has been a great learning experience!

## Todo:
* Implement deletion
* Support more relationships than just parent-child
* Make search bar more accessible 
* Implement functionality for the rest of the menu icons
* Implement fancy transition animations
  * Namely, inflate card to entire screen when user clicks
* Implement a view that shows an actual family tree
